# Codebase Concerns

**Analysis Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

<guidelines>
- Every concern must include concrete file paths.
- Be specific with measurements (e.g., "p95 500ms") not adjectives ("slow").
- Include reproduction steps for bugs, and "safe change" advice for fragile areas.
- This document is about risk and leverage: what breaks, where, and how to change safely.
</guidelines>

<good_examples>
Example (good):
- "Auth refresh tokens are stored unencrypted in `src/auth/tokenStore.ts` and logged in `src/auth/logger.ts` (risk: credential leakage). Fix: remove token logging and encrypt at rest. Repro: enable debug logging and observe tokens in logs."
- "Checkout endpoint p95 is 1.8s in staging due to N+1 queries in `src/db/orders.ts` (see `getOrdersForUser`). Fix: batch query and add integration test asserting query count."
</good_examples>

## Downstream Impact Ranking

Rank the top 3 concerns by how much future work they block. Use the Change Routing table in ARCHITECTURE.md as reference: concerns that block multiple change-routing rows rank highest.

| Rank | Concern | Blocks | Severity | Fix effort |
|------|---------|--------|----------|------------|
| 1 | [Concern name] | [Which change types from ARCHITECTURE.md this blocks] | critical/moderate/minor | [small/medium/large] |
| 2 | [Concern name] | [Blocks] | [Severity] | [Effort] |
| 3 | [Concern name] | [Blocks] | [Severity] | [Effort] |

Ranking heuristic: a concern that blocks 3 change-routing rows ranks above one that blocks 1, even if the latter is more severe in isolation.
