# GSDD Role Distillation Ledger

Evidence map from each of the 10 canonical GSDD roles to their GSD sources, with keep/strip/why rationale. This ledger documents why each role exists in its current form and what GSD content was distilled or merged.

---

## 1. Mapper

**Canonical role:** `agents/mapper.md`

**GSD source:** `agents/_archive/gsd-codebase-mapper.md`

**Merger type:** Kept-as-is (function scope preserved, output contract simplified)

**Kept from GSD:**
- Mandatory initial-read discipline for context files
- 4 focus areas (tech, arch, quality, concerns)
- Output contract with artifact names and downstream consumers
- Core algorithm: parse → explore → fill template → write → confirm

**Stripped from GSD:**
- Multi-file codebase output reduced to 4-file standard (see D1)
- Validator-pass patterns (GSDD trusts agent reads, not file validation)

**Gained in GSDD:**
- Explicit "Downstream Consumers" section (shows who uses mapper output)
- Clear guidance on prescriptive vs. descriptive output (helps agents write better code)

**Rationale:** Mapper is the lowest-level, most stable role. Its core job (explore + document) hasn't changed, but the output set shrank from 7 files to 4 files per D1 (lean context decision). The agent role contract itself needed no substantive changes.

---

## 2. Researcher

**Canonical role:** `agents/researcher.md`

**GSD sources:** `agents/_archive/gsd-project-researcher.md` + `agents/_archive/gsd-phase-researcher.md` (merged)

**Merger type:** Merged (same algorithm, different scope parameter)

**Kept from GSD:**
- Mandatory initial-read discipline
- Research scope (project vs. phase)
- Research mode (ecosystem, feasibility, comparison)
- Core algorithm: receive scope → identify domains → execute tool hierarchy → verify → write → return structured result
- Quality guarantees (training data = hypothesis, honest reporting, investigation not confirmation, confidence levels on every finding)
- Research pitfalls and prevention strategies

**Stripped from GSD:**
- Separate role contracts for project-researcher and phase-researcher (merged into one with scope parameter)
- Tool-specific shell commands (kept portable tool contracts instead)

**Gained in GSDD:**
- Explicit "Scope" table showing scope × trigger × focus × output location
- Clear statement: "Same algorithm, different scope. The scope is a context input, not a different role."

**Rationale:** The GSD original had two roles (project and phase researcher) that followed the identical algorithm but with a scope parameter. GSDD merged them into one canonical role taking scope as input, reducing the role count from 11 to 9 (later 10 with approach-explorer in D29) while preserving all leverage. This is the clean merger mentioned in D2.

---

## 3. Synthesizer

**Canonical role:** `agents/synthesizer.md`

**GSD source:** `agents/_archive/gsd-research-synthesizer.md` (with recovery hardening from PR #15)

**Merger type:** Kept-as-is (hardened in 2026-03-13)

**Kept from GSD:**
- Mandatory initial-read discipline
- Input contract: all 4 research files (STACK, FEATURES, ARCHITECTURE, PITFALLS)
- Output contract: SUMMARY.md with executive summary, key findings, roadmap implications, confidence/gaps
- Downstream consumer (roadmapper) and what it needs
- 6-step execution flow: read → synthesize → extract → derive → assess → write

**Stripped from GSD:**
- Conditional skip logic (kept mandatory synthesizer per D5 original decision)
- Vendor-specific output formatting

**Gained in GSDD (PR #15 hardening):**
- Explicit required files list with blocked-return pattern (do not guess from partial context, return blocked status naming missing file)
- "Be opinionated" guidance to roadmapper
- Stronger structured-return contract

**Rationale:** Synthesizer is a thin single-step role with no merge or extraction needed. It was hardened in PR #15 to restore explicit structure and completion discipline, but the core function and leverage remained unchanged from GSD.

---

## 4. Planner

**Canonical role:** `agents/planner.md`

**GSD sources:** `agents/_archive/gsd-planner.md` + `agents/_archive/gsd-plan-checker.md` (merged)

**Merger type:** Merged (orchestration ownership transferred to native adapters)

**Kept from GSD:**
- Mandatory initial-read discipline
- Phase goal decomposition and dependency graphs
- Goal-backward verification (must-haves, artifacts, key links)
- Planner responsibility and scope
- Input contract (SPEC, ROADMAP, codebase context, prior phase artifacts)
- Output contract (PLAN.md with frontmatter, objective, context references, typed tasks)

**Stripped from GSD:**
- Separate plan-checker role (now a delegate at `distilled/templates/delegates/plan-checker.md`)
- GSD's native 3-cycle verification loop (embedded in planner) → moved to native adapter surfaces (Claude skill, OpenCode command, Codex agent)
- Vendor-specific fresh-context orchestration logic

**Gained in GSDD:**
- Explicit scope boundary: "plan-scoped, does not own verification or milestone audit"
- Goal-backward section with 4 clear questions
- Planning process section with concrete steps
- Reference to plan-checker delegate for fresh-context review
- Reduced-assurance fallback mode description (when no independent checker runs)

**Rationale:** GSD's plan-checker was a separate role running a 3-cycle revision loop. GSDD merged planner and plan-checker into a single portable contract, but preserved the adversarial review concept through native adapter surfaces. The portable workflow describes the reduced-assurance fallback. This is the high-impact merger from D2 with full tradeoff documentation.

---

## 5. Roadmapper

**Canonical role:** `agents/roadmapper.md`

**GSD source:** `agents/_archive/gsd-roadmapper.md` (with recovery hardening from PR #15)

**Merger type:** Kept-as-is (hardened in 2026-03-13)

**Kept from GSD:**
- Mandatory initial-read discipline
- Bounded section structure (phases, requirements, success criteria, coverage validation)
- Explicit coverage validation
- Parse-critical artifact contract
- Structured return modes
- Checklist-driven completion

**Stripped from GSD:**
- Template-path references (output lives in `.planning/ROADMAP.md`)
- Commit steps (GSDD handles git separately)
- Vendor-specific file conventions

**Gained in GSDD (PR #15 hardening):**
- Explicit `.planning/ROADMAP.md` ownership contract
- Explicit `[ ]` / `[-]` / `[x]` status grammar
- Concrete `ROADMAP CREATED` artifact example
- Hard boundary: "this role does not settle the separate ROADMAP/STATE lifecycle seam"

**Rationale:** Roadmapper was over-distilled in the initial extraction; PR #15 recovered visible structure and completion discipline. The core role and leverage were intact; hardening just restored the guardrails that improve compliance.

---

## 6. Executor

**Canonical role:** `agents/executor.md`

**GSD source:** `agents/_archive/gsd-executor.md` (with substantial hardening from PR #16)

**Merger type:** Kept-as-is (hardened significantly in 2026-03-13)

**Kept from GSD:**
- Plan-scoped execution discipline
- Task implementation and deviation handling
- Git action recording without repo-specific naming assumptions
- Checkpoint protocol
- Completion summary
- State update responsibility

**Stripped from GSD:**
- Bash recipe patterns and shell-specific guidance
- Tool-specific directory naming conventions

**Gained in GSDD (PR #16 hardening):**
- Explicit scope boundary with 6 things executor does NOT own
- Clearer deviation rules with priority order (auto-fix bugs first)
- Success criteria confirmation requirement
- Verify quality checks now live inside task_completeness (runnable, fast, ordered)
- Stronger commitment to documented deviations

**Rationale:** Executor is the most complex role, with the broadest deviation surface. PR #16 audit recovered substantive guardrails: explicit scope boundaries, rule priority, and verification discipline. The ~150-line executor contract expanded to ~400 lines because the detail prevents misalignment, not because the job changed.

---

## 7. Verifier

**Canonical role:** `agents/verifier.md`

**GSD source:** `agents/_archive/gsd-verifier.md` (with selective hardening from D2)

**Merger type:** Kept-as-is (scope preserved; cross-phase audit extracted separately)

**Kept from GSD:**
- Phase-level goal-backward verification
- Exists/Substantive/Wired gate
- Anti-pattern scan
- Output contract with compact base fields (phase, verified, status, score)
- Verification-report structure

**Stripped from GSD:**
- Cross-phase integration audit scope (extracted as separate role + workflow)
- GSD's narrative all-encompassing verification

**Gained in GSDD:**
- Richer structured verifier findings (re_verification, gaps, human_verification) when material
- Explicit boundaries: "phase-scoped only, cross-phase integration is a separate concern"
- D2 cross-reference: why integration-checker exists as a separate role

**Rationale:** Verifier's phase-level job is unchanged. The extraction of integration-checker as a separate milestone surface (D2, PR #12) made verifier smaller and clearer. Phase verification and milestone integration audit are now distinct concerns with explicit handoff points.

---

## 8. Integration-Checker

**Canonical role:** `agents/integration-checker.md`

**GSD source:** `agents/_archive/gsd-integration-checker.md` (with structural recovery in PR #12 and systemic hardening in PR #15)

**Merger type:** Extracted as standalone role (cross-phase scope differs structurally from phase verification)

**Kept from GSD:**
- Mandatory initial-read discipline
- Cross-phase wiring verification (exports → imports, APIs → consumers, forms → handlers, data → display)
- E2E flow tracing
- Typed structured return
- Checklist-driven completion

**Stripped from GSD (intentional):**
- Framework-specific Bash recipes
- Hardcoded path assumptions
- File-extension-specific grep flags
- Tool-specific details that don't survive vendor-agnostic distillation

**Gained in GSDD:**
- PR #12: explicit section boundaries, stronger structured output, cleaner split between role contract and milestone workflow
- PR #15: recovered compliance guardrails, restored mandatory read enforcement, explicit auth-protection verification
- D2 reference: structural difference from phase verifier
- New in D21 (PR #35): Step 4a matrix-driven auth verification (if AUTH_MATRIX.md exists)

**Rationale:** GSD's integration-checker was a separate surface but lived in the shadows of the main role contracts. PR #12 extracted it fully; PR #15 recovered its substantive guardrails. The role is different from verifier because it owns milestone scope (all-phase wiring) vs. phase scope (phase goal). This is the cleanest separation in D2.

---

## 9. Debugger

**Canonical role:** `agents/debugger.md`

**GSD source:** `agents/_archive/gsd-debugger.md` (no changes)

**Merger type:** Kept-as-is (unchanged)

**Kept from GSD:**
- Systematic debugging methodology
- Hypothesis formulation and testing
- State persistence across context resets
- Structured checkpoint protocol
- Deviation handling

**Stripped from GSD:** (nothing significant)
- Minor tool path references

**Gained in GSDD:** (nothing)
- The role is kept as-is for compatibility

**Rationale:** Debugger is a standalone utility role with no dependencies on other roles. It was preserved exactly as-is from GSD because it works and has no vendor lock-in. It's used ad-hoc when agents encounter failures, not as part of the main workflow pipeline.

---

## 10. Approach-Explorer

**Canonical role:** `agents/approach-explorer.md`

**GSD sources:** `workflows/discuss-phase.md` + `workflows/list-phase-assumptions.md` + `workflows/discovery-phase.md` (merged into new role)

**Merger type:** New role from 2 GSD sources (discuss-phase + list-phase-assumptions) with thematic input from discovery-phase

**Kept from GSD:**
- Gray area identification with 5 domain types (SEE/CALL/RUN/READ/ORGANIZED) from discuss-phase
- Scope guardrail: phase boundary is fixed, deferred ideas captured not acted on
- 5-dimension assumption surfacing (technical approach, implementation order, scope boundaries, risks, dependencies) with confidence levels from list-phase-assumptions
- Deferred ideas capture from discuss-phase
- Adaptive area-by-area deep questioning from discuss-phase (GSD used 4-question batches; GSDD uses adaptive convergence)

Note: `discovery-phase.md` contributed the concept of pre-planning research but the mechanism is entirely different — GSD used 3-level depth workflows (Quick/Standard/Deep) as a separate invocation; GSDD uses per-gray-area research subagents embedded in the plan workflow. This is thematic inspiration, not a structural merger.

**Stripped from GSD:**
- `gsd-tools.cjs` dependencies and STATE.md updates
- Vendor-specific commit steps, path conventions, and "Claude" references
- CONTEXT.md output format (replaced with structured APPROACH.md)
- Separate workflow invocation (absorbed into plan workflow as inline + research subagent hybrid)
- Rigid 4-question batched loop (replaced with adaptive questioning until decision converges)

**Gained in GSDD:**
- XML semantic structure matching planner pattern (`<role>`, `<algorithm>`, `<examples>`, etc.)
- 3 few-shot conversation examples (taste decision, technical decision, hybrid + delegation)
- Gray area classification: taste (ask directly), technical (research first), hybrid (both)
- Pre-question research per gray area via isolated research subagents returning compressed summaries
- Self-check quality gate before writing APPROACH.md
- Intermediate decision persistence (protect against context limits)
- JIT context loading with extraction guidance (read ONLY locked decisions from SPEC, ONLY phase goal from ROADMAP)
- Structured approach comparison with trade-offs
- File persistence to `{padded_phase}-APPROACH.md` using dedicated template
- Plan-checker integration via new `approach_alignment` verification dimension
- Config toggle (`workflow.discuss: true|false`) for optional skip
- Downstream consumer contract: planner reads locked decisions, plan-checker verifies alignment
- "Agent's Discretion" explicit marking for areas where user delegates choice (vendor-neutral)
- Hybrid architecture: conversation inline (main context) + research in subagents. Native agent kept as optimization.

**Rationale:** GSDD's initial distillation dropped GSD's discuss-phase and list-phase-assumptions entirely, removing genuine leverage: the planner converges on a single approach without user input, explores no alternatives, and surfaces no assumptions. The approach explorer recovers this phase-level user alignment by combining GSD's discuss-phase interaction pattern with comparative research. Ground-up rewrite (D29) applied 5 external resources on context engineering, meta-prompting, and agent skill design to produce a prompt-engineered role contract with proper XML structure, examples, adaptive conversation, and hybrid research isolation.

## Summary: Merger Table (from D2)

| Canonical role | Absorbs from GSD | Merger criteria |
|---|---|---|
| `mapper.md` | `gsd-codebase-mapper.md` | Kept-as-is; output set changed per D1 (7 → 4 files) |
| `researcher.md` | `gsd-project-researcher.md` + `gsd-phase-researcher.md` | Scope parameter instead of separate role |
| `synthesizer.md` | `gsd-research-synthesizer.md` | Kept-as-is; hardened in PR #15 |
| `planner.md` | `gsd-planner.md` + `gsd-plan-checker.md` | Orchestration ownership moved to native adapters; portable checker-delegate created |
| `roadmapper.md` | `gsd-roadmapper.md` | Kept-as-is; hardened in PR #15 |
| `executor.md` | `gsd-executor.md` | Kept-as-is; heavily hardened in PR #16 |
| `verifier.md` | `gsd-verifier.md` | Kept-as-is; cross-phase audit extracted to integration-checker |
| `integration-checker.md` | `gsd-integration-checker.md` | Extracted as standalone; recovered in PR #12, hardened in PR #15 |
| `debugger.md` | `gsd-debugger.md` | Kept-as-is; no changes |
| `approach-explorer.md` | `discuss-phase.md` + `list-phase-assumptions.md` + `discovery-phase.md` | New role from 3 GSD workflow sources |

**Result:** 11 GSD roles → 10 GSDD canonical roles (2 mergers: researcher, planner). 1 extraction: integration-checker moved from embedded to standalone. 1 addition: approach-explorer recovers discuss-phase leverage with research enhancement. Total leverage preserved and extended.

## Role Contract Design Principles

Cross-source best practices applied to GSDD role contracts, audited against 6 external resources. These principles govern how role contracts should be written and revised. Ranked by impact.

> **Source note:** "Anthropic CE" in this section refers to Anthropic's "Building effective agents" (Dec 2024) for orchestration and sub-agent patterns, and LangChain's "Context Engineering for Agents" (2025) for Write/Select/Compress/Isolate context management patterns. They are cited separately where attribution is precise.

### Architecture-Level (highest leverage)

| Principle | What It Means | Source | GSDD Implementation |
|-----------|--------------|--------|---------------------|
| **Context isolation** | Research and heavy reads go in subagents; only compressed summaries enter the main context | Anthropic "Building effective agents" (Dec 2024): orchestrator-worker pattern — sub-agents do deep technical work and return condensed summaries | Approach explorer research subagents return ~1000-token summaries; plan-checker runs in fresh context |
| **JIT context loading** | Never say "read everything." Specify what to extract from each file | LangChain "Context Engineering for Agents" (2025): Select step of Write/Select/Compress/Isolate — load only the specific content needed, not full files | `<input_contract>` with extraction guidance: "From SPEC.md read ONLY locked decisions" |
| **Intermediate persistence** | For long interactions, write confirmed state to disk incrementally | Anthropic BEA: agent memory outside context window. LangChain CE: Write pattern — confirmed state persisted to disk | Approach explorer writes decisions to disk as they're confirmed during conversation |
| **Progressive disclosure** | Don't front-load all context; let agents discover incrementally | LangChain CE: Compress/Isolate patterns — agents assemble understanding incrementally rather than loading everything upfront | Gray areas presented individually; research loaded per area on demand |

### Prompt Structure (medium leverage)

| Principle | What It Means | Source | GSDD Implementation |
|-----------|--------------|--------|---------------------|
| **XML semantic structure** | Use XML tags to separate role, instructions, examples, inputs, outputs, anti-patterns | Anthropic Claude: "XML tags help Claude parse complex prompts unambiguously" | All roles use `<role>`, most use `<quality_guarantees>`, `<anti_patterns>`. Approach-explorer adds `<algorithm>`, `<examples>`, `<scope_guardrail>` |
| **Anti-patterns early** | Place "don't do this" instructions near the top, after role definition | Anthropic Claude prompting docs: critical information at the beginning receives more attention (primacy effect in long-context prompts) | `<anti_patterns>` placed immediately after `<role>` in all roles that have them |
| **Few-shot examples** | Show the pattern of interaction, not just output format | Anthropic Claude: "3-5 examples for best results." Examples in `<example>` tags | Approach-explorer: 3 examples. Other roles use inline format examples within algorithm sections |
| **Self-check before output** | Run an explicit checklist before producing the final artifact | OpenAI: "verification loops." Anthropic Claude: "Ask Claude to self-check" | Approach-explorer step 7; planner `<plan_self_check>`; executor completion verification |
| **Scope boundaries with heuristics** | Don't just list in/out of scope — give the agent a judgment rule | Novel, validated in approach-explorer | "Does this clarify implementation within the phase, or does it add a capability that could be its own phase?" |

### Language & Tone (lower leverage, still matters)

| Principle | What It Means | Source | GSDD Implementation |
|-----------|--------------|--------|---------------------|
| **Authority language: intentional leverage** | Anthropic Claude warns "CRITICAL:" can overtrigger on newer models. GSDD decision: **keep CRITICAL: for mandatory initial-read** — a genuine compliance-critical instruction where skipping causes cascading failures. Emphasis markers work when rare and specific (signal-to-noise principle: one CRITICAL: in a role contract is a load-bearing gate; ten would be noise). Use normal language for algorithm steps, scope guidance, and quality rules. | Anthropic Claude prompting docs (overtriggering caution) + technical writing signal-to-noise principle. GSDD applies the caution selectively: only compliance-critical context gates use CRITICAL: | `CRITICAL: Mandatory initial read` kept in all 7 roles. `NEVER` kept for security (mapper secret protection). Normal language used for algorithm steps, scope guidance, and quality rules |
| **Tell what to do, not just what not to do** | Anti-patterns alone are insufficient; pair with positive instructions | Anthropic Claude: "Tell Claude what to do instead of what not to do" | Every role has both `<anti_patterns>` AND positive algorithm/process sections |
| **Context for instructions** | Explain WHY a rule exists so the agent can generalize | Anthropic Claude: "Providing context or motivation behind your instructions helps Claude better understand your goals" | Research quality rules explain WHY: "Training data is a hypothesis. Verify before asserting." |

### Novel Patterns (not from any source)

These patterns emerged from GSDD's specific needs and were validated through implementation:

| Pattern | What It Does | Where Used |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Taste/Technical/Hybrid classification** | Adapts research depth to decision type; taste needs no research, technical does | Approach-explorer step 2 |
| **Research quality rules** | "One viable option is valid" / "Don't manufacture trade-offs" | Approach-explorer step 3 |
| **5-dimension assumption surfacing** | Forces transparency about inferences vs. confirmed facts, with confidence levels | Approach-explorer step 6 |
| **Agent's Discretion delegation** | User can explicitly say "you decide" — reduces fatigue on low-stakes choices | Approach-explorer step 4, planner `<approach_decisions>` |
| **Domain classification table** | SEE/CALL/RUN/READ/ORGANIZED determines gray area focus per phase type | Approach-explorer step 2 |
| **Degrees of freedom mapping** | Taste=high freedom, technical=low freedom (research-constrained). GSDD-originated: applies statistical degrees-of-freedom concept to prompt design scope | Approach-explorer classification system |

### Source Ranking

Sources are ranked by soundness for agent prompt design. Higher-ranked sources take precedence when sources disagree.

1. **Anthropic — "Building effective agents" (Dec 2024)** — Agent architecture patterns with production evidence (Claude Code). Most authoritative for orchestrator-worker design, sub-agent fresh context, and task decomposition.
2. **LangChain — "Context Engineering for Agents" (2025)** — Write/Select/Compress/Isolate framework. Most authoritative for context window management, JIT loading, and information flow patterns.
3. **Anthropic — Claude Prompting Best Practices (Claude 4.6)** — Model-specific, up-to-date. Critical for behavioral warnings (overtriggering, subagent overuse). Supersedes general guidance for Claude-targeted agents.
4. **OpenAI — Prompt Guidance (GPT-5.4)** — Deepest general-purpose reference. Novel concepts: completeness contracts, verification loops, tool persistence rules, empty result recovery. Model-specific but patterns transfer.
5. **OpenAI Cookbook — Meta-Prompting** — Narrow scope: LLM-as-judge evaluation, iterative prompt refinement. Useful technique, not a framework. See also: Suzgun & Kalai "Meta-Prompting" (2024, arXiv 2401.12954).
6. **JBurlison/MetaPrompts** — Structural skeleton (agent/skill/prompt/instruction hierarchy). Minimal actual guidance on prompt quality.

### Key Discrepancy Resolution

When sources conflict, these resolutions apply:

| Conflict | Resolution | Why |
|----------|------------|-----|
| Authority language ("YOU MUST" vs. normal) | Keep CRITICAL: for mandatory initial-read (compliance-critical). Use normal language elsewhere | Emphasis markers work when rare and specific (signal-to-noise). Anthropic's overtriggering concern applies to general guidance; a single CRITICAL: for a mandatory context gate is a load-bearing instruction, not noise |
| Example count (2 vs. 3-5) | Target 3+ for conversational agents; inline format examples are sufficient for structured output agents | Anthropic's 3-5 recommendation is general; interactive roles benefit more than output-only roles |
| Subagent return size (200 vs. 1000-2000 tokens) | Use 300-500 tokens | Anthropic's 1000-2000 is upper bound; 200 was too tight for structured approach summaries with trade-offs |
| "Don't invent alternatives" vs. "try fallback strategies" | Keep "don't invent" for approach research; use fallbacks for information retrieval | These solve different problems: manufacturing fake options is worse than acknowledging one viable path |
